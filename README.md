# ESR_API: a Ruby on Rails API for the NHS ESR System

## .env file

To get started, you need a `.env` file with secrets. For testing there is a `.env.example` file included in the repo that you can use, just remove the `.example` from the filename. Make sure to change all these secrets before running in production!

## Booting up

If you have Docker on your machine, run:

```
docker-compose up
```

It can then be accessed at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

On the first run you need to create, migrate and optionally seed the database:

```
docker-compose run api bundle exec rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
docker-compose run api bundle exec rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test
```

## Admin Authentication

Auth0 is used for login. You need to add your client ID and secret to the env file in the Auth0 section.

## API Authentication

Auth0 is used for API authentication. Your client application will need to request a bearer JSON Web Token for the API from Auth0, and pass the bearer token in the header in requests to the API. See the 'Test' section of an Auth0 API application for more details on how to request and use the bearer token, eg https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/eu/sardjv-dev/apis/5ed65b72dec4c8001874bd6f/test

## Deployment without Docker

If you can run [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)), that is the quickest way to get started. If Docker install is not possible, the Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml and Gemfile files included in the repository can be used as a guide for dependencies.

Core dependencies:

- Ruby 2.7 [https://github.com/ruby/ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby)
- Rails 6.0.2.1 [https://github.com/rails/rails](https://github.com/rails/rails)
- Redis 5.0.8 [https://redis.io/](https://redis.io/)
- Sidekiq 6.0.6 [https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq)
- PostgreSQL 12.2, MySQL 8.0.19 or SQL Server 2017
- Multiple supporting gems as listed in the Gemfile, Bundler (included in Ruby) should take care of installing these.

## Documentation

The API documentation can be viewed at [http://localhost:3000/api_docs](http://localhost:3000/api_docs).

The Swagger docs are generated from the RSpec tests in `spec/controllers/api` To rebuild the swagger docs:

```
docker-compose run api bundle exec rails rswag
```

## Licenses

You can check the licenses of unaccepted dependencies using:

```
bundle exec license_finder
```

This repo currently treats some licenses as 'accepted' and does not list repos with that license:

## ETL and Kiba

This project uses the [Kiba](https://github.com/thbar/kiba) gem for scalable and maintainable data processing.

[This talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxVtbog7pIQ) contains a short, clear explanation of how Kiba works.

### Tips
- Don't insert rows one by one - use bulk insert.
- Skip activerecord validations because they are too slow, find other ways to validate data.
- Fail fast; raise an exception and stop on failure rather than trying to carry on and creating bad data.

## Specs

To run Rubocop, and listen for file changes:

```
docker-compose run api bundle exec guard
```

Just press enter to run the whole test suite straight away.

## Code Coverage

After running the test suite, open the coverage/index.html file in a web browser to check what code is covered by the tests.

```
open coverage/index.html
```

## Debugging

To access a 'byebug' debugging point, run with:

```
docker-compose run --service-ports api
```

## Database

To change database between MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQL Server:

1) Uncomment the relevent line in Dockerfile
2) Uncomment the relevant section in docker-compose.yml
3) Uncomment the relevant config in database.yml
4) Uncomment the relevant gem(s) in the Gemfile.

## Accessing the database console

To access the MySQL database console:

```
docker-compose exec mysql bash
mysql -u root -p
(enter root password)
show databases;
use esr_api_development;
SELECT * FROM person_records;
```
